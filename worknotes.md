Changed config.defaultTemplate to the minimal template. The tabs weren't showing up on new blogs, this is because we were using an old version of the template. Why that changed between the two installations remains a mystery.

A couple of weeks ago I basically took the Scripting News template and ran the Drummer blogs through it.  

I spent a couple of days cleaning up and simplifying the template, adding tabs for a blog, linkblog and about outline, and removing functionality that didn't prove useful for Scripting News. At times there were tabs for chat, a river of news, others.  

The template is in a templates folder here, with space for more templates to be added.
